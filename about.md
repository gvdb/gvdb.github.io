My name is Glen van den Bergen. I'm a PhD student at The University of Queensland, Australia.

In my PhD project I am modelling and optimising properties of antimicrobial peptides to better understand their activity and selectivity.

I have used evolutionary algorithms and computer simulations to investigate the molecular details of these types of peptides.
