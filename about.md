My name is Glen van den Bergen. I'm a finishing PhD student at The University of Queensland, Australia.

In my PhD project I am modelled and optimised properties of antimicrobial peptides to better understand their activity and selectivity. I have used evolutionary algorithms and computer simulations to investigate the molecular details of these types of peptides.

As someone whose main interest is technology, you wouldn't know that I spent most of my childhood getting lost in the jungles of a small tropical island called Bougainville, somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Then as a teenager living in Malaysia, before the Internet, after waking up to the morning prayer played over a loud speaker at the nearby mosque, I had lots of free time to spend at the sports park swimming, playing squash, badminton, and going bowling. And yet, ever since I could press the Start button on a game controller, technology is something I've always taken a keen interest in.

During my free time when I’m not tinkering with projects on the Raspberry Pi or reading articles on [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/) I’m either indulging my 3 year old son’s obsession with dinosaurs at the museum, baking sourdough bread, putting on a batch of homebrew, or gardening.

More detail about what I've done and what I'm interested is in my [resume](assets/Glen_van_den_Bergen_CV_Resume.pdf).
